We take a train/test split on our data right away and try not spend a lot of time using the testing data set. Instead, we take our training data and tune our models using cross-validation. When we think we are done, we do one last test on the testing data to make sure we haven't accidently overfit to our training data.\n",

So, we would expect the accuracy on this test set to be artificially inflated as compared to actual \"out-of-sample\" data.\n",

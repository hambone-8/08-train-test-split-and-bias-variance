You might train on the entire dataset as the very last step when a model is chosen, hoping to make the final model as accurate as possible. Or, you could use this to estimate the degree of overfitting.\n",
    "2. **Train-test-split** is useful if cross-validation is not practical (e.g. it takes too long to train). It is also useful for computing a quick confusion matrix. You could also use this as a final step after the model is finalized (often called evaluating the model against a **validation set**).\n",
    "3. **Cross-validation** is the gold standard for estimating accuracy and comparing accuracy across models.\n",

You can see more here: `sklearn` [toy data sets](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#toy-datasets). These are useful to practice with since there are many tutorials and examples on the internet to compare your results against or to use for guidance."
